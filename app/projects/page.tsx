    summary:
      "Connecticut's DMV registration process for private vehicle sales was paper-heavy, slow, and required in-person visits — friction the system had accepted for decades. Tony founded LCL Business Solutions, assembled a four-person team, and designed a dual mobile app allowing consumers to schedule a registration appointment while a trained DMV 2.0 field employee came to their location, processed all documentation via mobile OCR and VIN verification, collected payment, and installed plates on the spot. A non-provisional patent application was filed with the USPTO and a trademark application was cleared. The concept was adopted as a policy platform element by a major-party Connecticut gubernatorial campaign before the project was discontinued following the 2018 election.",

Tony designed and deployed the full collaboration and productivity stack, architected a modular training platform spanning MMA, BJJ, boxing, Muay Thai, and bare-knuckle disciplines, and built fighter performance analytics infrastructure capturing training load, progression, and fight preparation metrics. He simultaneously designed a two-phase consumer digital platform roadmap — Phase 1 monetizing sponsorships and ticket sales to self-fund Phase 2's full platform buildout — and developed a structured sponsorship pipeline converting ad hoc conversations into a tracked, measurable revenue stream.",

Grenier Scholarship Foundation alongside Jared's friends and family — not as a career accomplishment, but because the people who loved him wanted his memory to mean something beyond grief. Tony secured full 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, designed the annual selection process from scratch, and has served as President continuously since founding. The scholarship is awarded each year to a graduating senior from Southington High School who best embodies the values Jared represented: friendship, loyalty, and love.

He returned to Ironman competition in 2021 — completing Ironman Florida under severe race conditions — and has finished Ironman Florida again in 2023 and 2024. Beginning in spring 2025, he added combat sports: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, kickboxing, Muay Thai, and MMA, completing two competitive BJJ matches and one live unsanctioned MMA smoker round. He is currently a BJJ white belt with one stripe, targeting blue belt as the prerequisite for sanctioned MMA competition. The dual milestone is actively in progress — timing contingent on belt progression.

Over five rotations across five distinct business units, he held nearly every role on a modern delivery team simultaneously — developer, business analyst, QA tester, Scrum Master, budget owner, and team leader — often within a single engagement. He also chaired the Leadership Development Intern Program during his LDP tenure, designing programming, mentoring early-career talent, and running the pipeline that fed future cohorts. The breadth of that foundation — built at a Fortune 100 insurer alongside ThoughtWorks consultants, years before Agile reached mainstream corporate adoption — is the ground-level credibility that distinguishes every transformation leadership role that followed.",
